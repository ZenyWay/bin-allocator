allocate values to bins defined by their lower bound delimitor value.

the ideal approach would have been to subclass Array and simply override the `Array#indexOf` method
such that it returns the index of the closest delimitor below the given value,
instead of returning the index of an exact match if any.
however, this is problematic, [especially in Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-wiki/blob/master/Breaking-Changes.md#extending-built-ins-like-error-array-and-map-may-no-longer-work)

instead, this module favors composition over inheritance,
and currently exposes only three properties of the underlying array,
which serve the purpose of allocating values to bins:
* Array#indexOf which is overridden with the previously described behaviour,
implemented as binary search in O(n).
* Array.length (readonly)
* Array#map which effectively provides indirect access to the underlying array.

an optional comparator function can be given at instantiation.

# <a name="example"></a> example
```ts
import getBinAllocator from 'bin-allocator'
import getRandomBinsFactory from 'randombins'
import debug = require('debug')
const log = debug('example:')
debug.enable('example:')

// create bins, i.e. a list of randomly selected bin delimitor strings
const getRandomBins = getRandomBinsFactory({ size: 16, randomshuffle: <T>(arr: T[]) => arr }) // no shuffle
const alphabet = '-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw_'
getRandomBins([ alphabet, alphabet ])
.then(bins => {
  const orderedbins = getBinAllocator(bins)
  log('number of bins:', orderedbins.length) // 16
  log('delimitor strings:', orderedbins.map(s => s)) // e.g. ["--", "-p", "bd", ..., "ws"]

  const words = [ 'this', 'is', 'an', 'example' ]
  const indexes = words.map(word => orderedbins.indexOf(word))

  log('indexes of bins for words %o: %o', words, indexes) // e.g. indexes of ... [12, 6, 1, 4]
})
```
